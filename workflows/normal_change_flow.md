# Normal Change Workflow

This workflow applies to planned, moderate-risk changes that require stakeholder awareness and formal approval.

---

### ðŸ”„ Normal Change Flow

1. **Initiator identifies the change**
   - Examples: infrastructure upgrades, access permission changes, system migrations

2. **Change Request is created**
   - Fill out [Change Request Template](/templates/change_request_template.md)
   - Include risk scoring and backout plan

3. **Initial Review by Manager or Change Owner**
   - Confirm accuracy and completeness of the request
   - Validate risk score and impact

4. **CAB Review (if required)**
   - High-scoring or cross-functional changes are routed to the Change Advisory Board
   - CAB provides feedback or approval within set SLA

5. **Schedule and Communicate**
   - Set date and time for implementation
   - Notify affected users and stakeholders

6. **Change is Implemented**
   - Follow defined procedures and fallback steps

7. **Post-Implementation Review**
   - Document result (success, partial success, rollback)
   - Share learnings if issues occurred

8. **Update Change Log**
   - Log details, outcome, and notes in [Change Log Tracker](/templates/change_log_tracker.md)
