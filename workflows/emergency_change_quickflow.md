# Emergency Change Workflow

Emergency changes are unplanned, high-priority changes that must be made immediately to prevent business disruption, security incidents, or data loss.

### ðŸš¨ Emergency Change Quick Flow

1. **Incident Detected**
   - Examples: system outage, vulnerability exploit, data breach, critical config failure

2. **Change Owner is Notified**
   - Responsible party is alerted or escalated immediately

3. **Emergency Change is Logged**
   - Create a fast-entry change record in [Change Log Tracker](/templates/change_log_tracker.md)
   - Include basic impact and reason for urgency

4. **Fast Approval or Verbal Authorization**
   - Manager or executive gives go-ahead (verbal or written Slack/email)
   - Approval must be documented after implementation

5. **Change is Implemented**
   - Fix is applied under supervision
   - Communicate change in real-time if needed

6. **Post-Change Documentation**
   - Complete a full [Change Request](/templates/change_request_template.md) after the fact
   - Run a [Retrospective Review](/examples/retrospective_summary_example.md)

7. **CAB Review (Post-Incident)**
   - CAB performs after-action review within 48 hours
   - Discuss lessons learned and prevent recurrence

### âœ… Requirements
- Clearly defined "emergency" criteria
- Verbal approval must be followed by documented approval
- Change must be recorded in the log and reviewed later

---

### ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Emergency process should be used sparingly
- Use in conjunction with incident response plans
- Audit trail must still be maintained
