# CAB Review Process

The Change Advisory Board (CAB) is responsible for reviewing, approving, and advising on changes that carry operational, compliance, or security risk.

1. **CAB Agenda Drafted**
   - Agenda created 24 hours before meeting
   - Includes submitted changes and owner notes

2. **Each Change is Presented**
   - Owner explains scope, risk score, mitigation, and timeline

3. **CAB Reviews and Asks Questions**
   - Focus on dependencies, rollback plans, business impact

4. **Decision is Made**
   - Approve, Reject, or Request Revisions
   - Decision is documented in the change log or meeting notes

5. **Post-Review Summary**

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Keep meetings under 30 minutes by limiting to high-priority changes
- Use a shared template for CAB agendas
- Ensure all decisions are logged for audit purposes
- Rotate members occasionally to bring in fresh insights

---

### üìå Notes

- CAB is a governance function, not a gatekeeping bottleneck
- If no meeting is needed, asynchronous review via Slack/email can still follow this framework
