### Message Body:

Hi Team,

We will be enabling Single Sign-On (SSO) via Okta for internal admin dashboards on **Thursday, July 18 at 8:00 PM ET**.

**What this means for you:**
- You will use your Okta credentials to log in
- Legacy username/password logins will no longer work
- The login update will take less than 5 minutes

There is no expected downtime, but we recommend saving any work before the update window begins.

If you experience issues logging in after the update, please contact IT Support via Slack or open a help desk ticket.

Thanks for your attention and for helping us keep your data secure!

Best,  
**Brianna James**  
IT Operations
