# GovernFlow

GovernFlow is a practical, lightweight change management toolkit for modern teams. Built from real-world GRC work, it helps organizations create structure, align on change processes, and stay audit-ready—without needing expensive platforms or complex frameworks.

---

## Why This Toolkit Exists

Many teams delay change governance because it feels too big to start. This project is designed to give you a clear, simple starting point to manage change risk, approval, and documentation—even if you're a team of one.

Use GovernFlow to:
- Build a minimum viable change management process
- Prepare for SOC 2, ISO 27001, or internal audits
- Train stakeholders on risk, ownership, and approvals
- Bring structure to fast-moving environments
